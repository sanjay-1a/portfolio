    <h1>Bank Vault Security System to avoid Money Heist using Human emotion</h1>

    <p>
      Security systems are becoming more and more important over the past few
      years. A multi-layer Bank Security System is for validating, monitoring
      and controlling the security threads in bank locker rooms. Today, there
      are many banks using authorize access control approach to prevent the
      locker from unauthorized access. In this project highly reliable,
      multilevel and most efficient locker security system has been designed.
      The system uses biometrics, such as a fingerprint scanner, RFID system,
      and face recognition technology, to only approve specific individuals for
      access. The micro controller will activate alarms and lock the locker room
      in the event of any illegal individuals. And alert the nearby police
      station. The proposed system increases the security systems in banks.
